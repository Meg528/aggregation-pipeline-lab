# ðŸ“˜ SQL vs Aggregations

## SQL

A SQL query statement usually starts with a `SELECT` where we put a list of the fields we need, then a `FROM` clause to state the table/s (or as in this case the subquery) that will return the rows. We can filter out using `WHERE` and group data using `GROUP`.

We read this from the inside. If there's too much nesting is not easy to follow.

```SQL
SELECT
    city,
    SUM(annual_spend) Total_Spend,
    AVG(annual_spend) Average_Spend,
    MAX(annual_spend) Max_Spend,
    COUNT(annual_spend) customers
FROM (
    SELECT t1.city, customer.annual_spend
    FROM customer 
    LEFT JOIN (
        SELECT address.address_id, city.city,
               address.customer_id, address.location
        FROM address LEFT JOIN city
        ON address.city_id = city.city_id
        ) AS t1
    ON
    (customer.customer_id = t1.customer_id AND
              t1.location = "home")
) AS t2
GROUP BY city;
```

## Equivalent MongoDB Aggregation Pipeline

Here we pass three stages, one to return one document per element in the `address` array, then we filter out to get only the documents that have a `home` address location and finally we do the grouping. As we'll see, this can be split and tested separately, and resembles our code. 

```js
db.customers.aggregate([
	{
		$unwind: "$address",
	},
	{
		$match: {"address.location": "home"}
	},
	{
		 $group: {
			_id: "$address.city",
			totalSpend: {$sum: "$annualSpend"},
			averageSpend: {$avg: "$annualSpend"},
			maximumSpend: {$max: "$annualSpend"},
			customers: {$sum: 1}
		}
	}
])
```
