# Structure of an aggregation pipeline

To interact with a relational database we typically use SQL, a 4th Generation language to access our data. With MongoDB we instead get data and transform it in incremental steps.

An aggregation pipeline is composed of [__stages__](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/operator/aggregation-pipeline/).

We pass an array of stages to the `aggregate` method like so:

```
db.mycollection.aggregate([
    stage1,
    stage2,
    stage3
])
```

## Example

An Aggregation Pipeline that does the same than above SQL statement could be:

```
db.mycollection.aggregate([
  {
    $sort:
      /**
       * Provide any number of field/order pairs.
       */
      {
        num_mflix_comments: -1,
      },
  },
  {
    $limit:
      /**
       * Provide the number of documents to limit.
       */
      1,
  },
  {
    $unwind:
      /**
       * path: Path to the array field.
       * includeArrayIndex: Optional name for index.
       * preserveNullAndEmptyArrays: Optional
       *   toggle to unwind null and empty values.
       */
      {
        path: "$cast",
      },
  },
  {
    $project:
      /**
       * Specifications: The fields to
       *   include or exclude.
       */
      {
        cast: 1,
      },
  },
])
```
