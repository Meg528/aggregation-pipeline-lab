# $match

This is the simplest one, similar to the `WHERE` SQL clause.

Say we want all books from 2010. We'll write:

```js
db.books.aggregate([{$match: {year: 2010}}])
```

ðŸ’» Return all the `books` that have exactly 100 pages.

<summary>Answer</summary>
<div>

```js
db.books.aggregate([{$match: {pages: 100}}])
```
</div>
</details>
