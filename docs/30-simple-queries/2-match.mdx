# $match

This is the simplest one, similar to the `WHERE` SQL clause.

Say we want all the books from 2010. We'll write:

```js
db.books.aggregate([{$match: {year: 2010}}])
```

ðŸ’» Return all the `books` that have exactly 100 pages.

<div>

```js
db.books.aggregate([{$match: {pages: 100}}])
```
</div>
</details>

## AND

If we need to add more conditions using AND, we can do it using the `$and` operator.

If we want all the books with 100 pages with exactly `totalInventory` 2 we can use an `$and` operator. This takes and array of documents with all the conditions that should be true for the AND to succeed:

```js
db.books.aggregate([{$match: {$and: [{pages: 100}, {totalInventory: 2}]}}])
```

The pseudo-code for this would be something like:

```
IF pages == 100 AND totalInventory == 2 {
    return matching docs
}
```

ðŸ’» Return all the `books` from 2015 that have exactly 100 pages.

<div>

```js
db.books.aggregate([{$match: {$and: [{pages: 100}, {year: 2015}]}}])
```
</div>
</details>

ðŸ’» How many are they? (_hint: use `itcount()`_).

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
<div>

```js
db.books.aggregate([{$match: {$and: [{pages: 100}, {year: 2015}]}}]).itcount()
```
</div>
</details>

### Shorthand AND

We can do an implicit AND just passing a document with all the conditions (instead of an array of documents):

```js
db.books.aggregate([{$match: {pages: 100, totalInventory: 2}}])
```

ðŸ’» Return all the `books` from 2015 that have exactly 100 pages, using the simple $and notation
