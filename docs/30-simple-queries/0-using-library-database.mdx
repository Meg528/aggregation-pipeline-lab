# Using the library database

## Select the library database

💻 We'll use the `library` database. To do that, in a MongoDB shell type in:

<Tabs groupId="aggregations">
  <TabItem value="mongosh" label="mongosh">

```js
use library
```

You can show all collections with

```js
show collections
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="atlas" label="Atlas UI">

Select the correct DB in the Atlas UI

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

🦸‍♂️ 💻 How would you switch to a database called `orders`?

:::info
Extra activity, do it if you have extra time or are following at home, won't be covered during the hands-on Lab
:::

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
<div>

```js
use orders
```

Even if this database does not yet exists, MongoDB can change to it. If we create a collection, users, etc. then this DB will get created.

Remember to get back to the library database by using:

```js
use library
```
</div>
</details>
