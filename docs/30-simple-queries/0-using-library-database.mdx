# 👐 Using the Library Database

## Select the library database

💻 We'll use the `library` database for all of the hands-on exercises in this lab. If you haven't already, import the [library data](https://mdb.link/import-library-data) into your database cluster.

<Tabs groupId="aggregations">
  <TabItem value="atlas" label="Atlas UI">

Select the correct database in the aggregation pipeline builder.

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="mongodb-shell" label="MongoDB Shell">

To do that, in a MongoDB shell, type:

```js
use library
```

You can show all collections with:

```js
show collections
```

🦸‍♂️ 💻 How would you switch to a database called `orders`?

:::info
Extra activity! Do it if you have extra time or are following along at home. It won't be covered during the hands-on lab.
:::

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
<div>

```js
use orders
```

Even if this database does not yet exist, MongoDB can change to it. If we create a collection, users, etc., then this DB will be created.

Remember to get back to the library database by using:

```js
use library
```
</div>
</details>
