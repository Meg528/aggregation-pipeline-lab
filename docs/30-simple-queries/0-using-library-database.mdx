# Using the library database

## Select the library database

We'll use the `library` database. To do that, in a MongoDB shell type in:

```js
use library
```

You can show all collections with

```js
show collections
```

💻 How would you switch to a database called `orders`?

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
<div>

```js
use orders
```
</div>
</details>
