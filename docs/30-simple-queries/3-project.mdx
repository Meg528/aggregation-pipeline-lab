If we're interested just in the titles, we can use `$project` to select just the fields we're interested in. As an example, to get just the book's title and year we'll write:

```js
db.books.aggregate([{$project: {title: 1, year: 1}}])
```

- 1 means "show that field"
- 0 means "hide that field"
- the primary key `_id` field is shown by default

So we can exclude fields and show all fields except `attributes` using:

```js
db.books.aggregate([{$project: {attributes: 0}}])
```

ðŸ’» Show only `title` and `cover`.

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
<div>

```js
db.books.aggregate([{$project: {title:1, cover: 1}}])
```
</div>
</details>

## Excluding fields

ðŸ’» Exclude the `cover`, `attributes` and `_id` fields from the result.

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
<div>

```js
db.books.aggregate([{$project: {_id_:0, attributes: 0, cover: 0}}])
```
</div>
</details>


## Including and excluding fields

:::danger

You can't include and exclude fields in the same projection: if you start including, you must keep including and vice versa.

:::

For instance, this will fail:

```js
db.books.aggregate([{$project: {title:1, attributes: 0}}])

MongoServerError: Invalid $project :: caused by :: Cannot do exclusion on field attributes in inclusion projection
```

:::info

The only exception to this rule is the `_id` field, which we can exclude in an inclusion projection

:::

```js
db.books.aggregate([{$project: {title:1, _id: 0}}])
```
