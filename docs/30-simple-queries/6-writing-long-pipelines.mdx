# Writing long pipelines

Aggregation pipelines can get very long, depending on how many stages we need to run. Writing a pipeline is writing code, as you will write it using one of the many MongoDB drivers in your own language. Here we're presenting the examples using JavaScript suitable for the MongoDB Shell [mongosh](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/mongodb-shell/), but if you are writing a microservice in Rust, you'll definitely write your pipelines in Rust.

:::danger
The following syntax doesn't work in the Atlas UI aggregations editor. The editor doesn't support declaring variables.
:::

This is why we should rewrite our last pipeline like this:

Get 15 books from 1985 with 150 pages. Show only the `title`, `year`, `totalInventory` and `available` books. (Sample doc [here](/docs/simple-queries/project))

```js
db.books.aggregate([
    {$match: {year: 1985, pages: 150}}, {$project: {_id: 0, title: 1, year: 1, totalInventory: 1, available: 1}}, {$limit: 15}
])
```
Will be changed into:


```js
let booksFrom1985With150pages = {$match: {year: 1985, pages: 150}};
let showOnlyTheseFields = {$project: {_id: 0, title: 1, year: 1, totalInventory: 1, available: 1}};
let getJust15books =  {$limit: 15};

db.books.aggregate([
    booksFrom1985With150pages,
    showOnlyTheseFields,
    getJust15books,
]);
```

Easier to read, and reason about, right?

ðŸ’» Try to run the above pipeline and compare your results: should be the same as before

:::tip

Write your aggregation pipelines like you'll compose functions in your programming language. Aggregations _are_ code that runs on the server. In the client you just express _what_ you want to be done, not _how_ to do it.

:::tip

As this is code, we can even add comments (starting with `//`) to our pipelines

ðŸ’» We can also use $gte to get the books with 150 pages or more. Check $gte syntax in the [docucumentation](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/operator/query/gte/) and write an aggregation pipeline to return 15 books from 1985 with more than 150 pages. Show only the `title`, `year`, `totalInventory` and `available` books. (Sample doc [here](/docs/simple-queries/project))

_Hint:_ we'll need to use `$and` as maybe this is a bit more complex.

let booksFrom1985WithMoreThan150pages = {$match: {$and: [{year: 1985}, moreThan150pages]}};
let showOnlyTheseFields = {$project: {_id: 0, title: 1, year: 1, totalInventory: 1, available: 1}};
let getJust15books =  {$limit: 15};

db.books.aggregate([
