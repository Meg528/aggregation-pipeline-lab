# Empty aggregation pipeline

## An empty aggregation

This code returns a [cursor](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/method/js-cursor/) with all documents in the `authors` collection:

<Tabs groupId="aggregations">
  <TabItem value="mongosh" label="mongosh">

```js
db.authors.aggregate([])
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="atlas" label="Atlas UI">

<Screenshot src="/img/30-simple-queries/atlas-aggregation.png" url="http://cloud.mongodb.com/yourcluster" alt="AtlasUI Showing the available DBs" />

- Open the Aggregation tab
- Select Text entry
- Type in the aggregation pipeline:

```js
[]
```
 
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>



We can iterate over this cursor and get more documents typing `it`. 

üíª Return all the documents in the `books` collection and iterate to get the next page of books.

## ü¶∏‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Cursor methods

A [cursor](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/method/js-cursor/) has several useful methods, for instance we can check the size of the returned cursor with `itcount`

```js
cursor.itcount()
```

üíª In our previous example with the empty aggregation, to check the size of the returned cursor, what should we type in?

<div>

```js
// as db.books.aggregate([]) returns a cursor we can just call itcount() on it
db.books.aggregate([]).itcount()
```
