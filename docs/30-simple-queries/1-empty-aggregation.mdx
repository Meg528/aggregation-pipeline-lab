# Empty aggregation pipeline

## An empty aggregation

This code returns a [cursor](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/method/js-cursor/) with all documents in the `authors` collection:

```js
db.authors.aggregate([])
```

We can iterate over this cursor and get more documents typing `it`. 

üíª Return all the documents in the `books` collection and iterate to get the next page of books.

A [cursor](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/method/js-cursor/) has several useful methods, for instance we can check the size of the returned cursor with `itcount`

```js
cursor.itcount()
```

üíª In our previous example with the empty aggregation, to check the size of the returned cursor, what should we type in?
