# Empty aggregation pipeline

## Use the library database

We'll use the `library` database. To do that, in a MongoDB shell type in:

```js
use library
```

Show all collections with

```js
show collections
```

üíª How would you switch to a database called `orders`?

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
<div>

```js
use orders
```
</div>
</details>

## An empty aggregation

This returns a cursor with all documents in the `authors` collection:

```js
db.authors.aggregate([])
```

We can iterate over it and get more documents typing `it`. 

üíª Return all the documents in the `books` collection and iterate to get the next page of books.

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
<div>

```js
db.books.aggregate([])
it
```
</div>
</details>

## Aggregation options

We can pass a document to `aggregate` with some options

let options = {

};

db.authors.aggregate([], options);
