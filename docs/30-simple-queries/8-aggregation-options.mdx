# 🦸‍♂️ Aggregation options

We can pass a document to `aggregate` with some options

let options = {
    maxTimeMS: 100
};

db.authors.aggregate([], options);


💻 Have a look at the [different options you can pass to the aggregate method](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/method/db.collection.aggregate/#mongodb-method-db.collection.aggregate).


💻 Try to launch an `itcount` (a long operation) to iterate through the whole books cursor with a time limt of 10 ms: you should see the operation timing out and failing.

```js
let options = {
    maxTimeMS: 10
};

db.authors.aggregate([], options).itcount();

> MongoServerError: operation exceeded time limit
```
