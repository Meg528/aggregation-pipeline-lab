# Adding new fields to results

We want to estimate the reading time for a book. But we don't have that field stored in our data.

```js
db.books.aggregate([
    {$project: {
        title: 1,
        pages: 1,
        }
    },
    {$set: {readingTimeHours: {$divide: [{$multiply: ["$pages", 2]}, 60]}}},
])
```

ðŸ’» Add a new field `notes` that contains `PLACEHOLDER` for all documents.

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
<div>

```js
db.books.aggregate([
    {$project: {
        title: 1,
        pages: 1,
        
    }
    
    },

    {$set: {notes: "PLACEHOLDER"}}
])
```

</div>
