# Searching inside Objects in arrays

In our books we're using the [Attribute Pattern](https://www.mongodb.com/developer/products/mongodb/attribute-pattern/) to have different attributes in our documents. As we can see in the [sample doc](/docs/simple-queries/project) we have an `attributes` array, containing several objects, each with the same structure:

```js
attributes: [
    {
      key: 'edition',
      value: '1st'
    },
    {
      key: 'dimensions',
      value: 'Height: 1.111 Inches, Length: 1.111 Inches, Weight: 0.2 Pounds, Width: 1.111 Inches'
    },
    {
      key: 'isbn13',
      value: '9780765342508'
    },
    {
      key: 'msrp',
      value: 6.99
    },
    {
      key: 'isbn',
      value: '0765342502'
    },
    {
      key: 'isbn10',
      value: '0765342502'
    }
  ],
```

How do we search for all the books that have an msrp of 9.99? We want books that, inside `attributes` has an object with key `msrp` and value `9.99`. We can think this works:

```js
let nineNinetyNine = {$match: {"attributes.key": "msrp", "attributes.value": 9.99}};
let showOnlyTheseFields = {$project: {_id: 0, title: 1, year: 1, totalInventory: 1, available: 1, "attributes": 1}};

db.books.aggregate([
    nineNinetyNine,
    showOnlyTheseFields,
]);
```

But it doesn't. This one works:

```js
db.books.aggregate([
    { $unwind : "$attributes" },
    {$match: {"attributes.key": "msrp", "attributes.value": 9.99} },
   {$project: {title: 1, attributes: 1}}
]);
```

Here we're getting a copy of each book for each object inside the `$attributes` array. This "flattens" the array and returns many copies of the same documents, one for each different attribute that we have which will be different for each of these generated docs.

To understand `$unwind`, run this aggregation

db.books.aggregate([
  { $match: {_id: "0002158698"} },
  { $unwind : "$genres" },
  { $project: {vectorizedSynopsis: 0, attributes: 0}}
]);
