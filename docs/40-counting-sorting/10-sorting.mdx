# Sorting

We can sort our results using the `$sort` stage:

Let's get all books from 1984, sorted by number of pages. We'll only show the title, pages and authors.

```js
let booksFrom1984 = {$match: {year: 1984}};
let showOnlyTheseFields = {$project: {_id: 0, title: 1, pages: 1, authors: 1}};
let slimmerBooksFirst = {$sort: {"pages": 1}}

db.books.aggregate([
    booksFrom1984,
    showOnlyTheseFields,
    slimmerBooksFirst,
]);
```

As we can see, we don't get any `pages` info as these documents don't have that information, hence is `null` and gets sorted as less than any number. We can sort the other way around:


```js
let booksFrom1984 = {$match: {year: 1984}};
let showOnlyTheseFields = {$project: {_id: 0, title: 1, pages: 1, authors: 1}};
let thickerBooksFirst = {$sort: {"pages": -1}}

db.books.aggregate([
    booksFrom1984,
    showOnlyTheseFields,
    thickerBooksFirst,
]);
```

ðŸ’» How can we get the thickest book from 1984?
