# $count

How can we be sure that this pipeline is returning exactly 10 books?

```js
let booksFrom1991With150pages = {$match: {year: 1991, pages: 150}};
let showOnlyTheseFields = {$project: {_id: 0, title: 1, year: 1, totalInventory: 1, available: 1}};
let getJust15books =  {$limit: 10};

db.books.aggregate([
    booksFrom1991With150pages,
    showOnlyTheseFields,
    getJust15books
]);
```

Counting the books! Let's add a new stage to the pipeline to count those books:

```js
let booksFrom1991With150pages = {$match: {year: 1991, pages: 150}};
let showOnlyTheseFields = {$project: {_id: 0, title: 1, year: 1, totalInventory: 1, available: 1}};
let getJust15books =  {$limit: 10};
let count = {$count: "totalBooks"}

db.books.aggregate([
    booksFrom1991With150pages,
    showOnlyTheseFields,
    getJust15books,
    count,
]);
```

Here, `$count` will count the resulting docs and will return a document with just one field: `totalBooks`

```js
{
  totalBooks: 10
}
```

## The order of stages is important

If we count after the `$match` stage, the document we're passing to the next steps contains only the `totalBooks` field. So the `$project` will return an empty document.

```js
let booksFrom1991With150pages = {$match: {year: 1991, pages: 150}};
let showOnlyTheseFields = {$project: {_id: 0, title: 1, year: 1, totalInventory: 1, available: 1}};
let getJust15books =  {$limit: 10};
let count = {$count: "totalBooks"}

db.books.aggregate([
    booksFrom1991With150pages,
    count,
    showOnlyTheseFields,
    getJust15books,
]);
```
