# ü¶∏ Saving to a collection

You can export the result of an aggregation pipeline to a different DB / Collection. To do that just add a last aggregation stage to your pipeline:

```js
{ $out: { db: "<output-db>", coll: "<output-collection>" } }
```

You can omit the `db` attribute, in which case the new collection is created in the current DB.

```js
{ $out: "<output-collection>" }
```

üëê Create a copy of the books with exactly 100 pages and output as a new collection named `OneHundredPagesBooks.

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
<div>

```js
let oneHundredPagesBooks = {$match: {pages: 100}};
let saveToNewCollection = {$out: "OneHundredPagesBooks"}

db.books.aggregate([
    oneHundredPagesBooks,
    saveToNewCollection
]);
```

After running this, we should see a new collection with:

```js
show collections
```
</div>
</details>
