# 👐 Set Up Lab

To follow along, you'll need:
- A MongoDB Atlas account.
- Test data. In this case, this is book, author, and review data for a library management system.

👐 To get both, open the [intro lab](https://mongodb-developer.github.io/intro-lab/docs/intro) and follow it (only takes 10-15 mins) to get your database ready. Return here when finished!
