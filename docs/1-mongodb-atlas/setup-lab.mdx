# Set up Lab

To follow along you'll need:
- a MongoDB Atlas account
- test data. In this case, this is books, authors and reviews data for a library management system.

ðŸ’» To get both, open the [Intro Lab](https://mongodb-developer.github.io/intro-lab/docs/intro) and follow it (only takes 10-15 mins) to get your database ready. Return here when finished!
