# Set up Lab

To follow along you'll need:
- a MongoDB Atlas account
- some test data, in this case this is Books, Authors and Reviews data for a Library management system.

ðŸ’» To get both, open the [Intro Lab](https://mongodb-developer.github.io/intro-lab/docs/intro) and follow it (only takes 10-15 mins) to get your database ready. Return here when finished!
